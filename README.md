# Assignment A4: Evolution

  - Author: Ursula Chui [chuiu@mcmaster.ca]

## Rationale and Explanation
This projects takes on A3 (previous model) and adapts it into a new format through the application of SFWRENG 2C03. It
aims to teach about the Adapter pattern and other GoF patterns that was taught in lecture to apply our knowledge to
a real-life example.

## How to run the product
To run MVP: 
```
	java -jar generator/generator.jar -k irregular -h 1080 -w 1920 -p 1000 -s 20 -o img/mvp.mesh; \
	java -jar island/island.jar -i img/mvp.mesh -o img/transition.mesh -s circle -m; \
	java -jar visualizer/visualizer.jar -i img/transition.mesh -o img/mvp.svg; \
	
```

To run MVP via makefile: 
```
    make MVP
```

To make an island: 
The dashes next to the options (-s, -a, -l, -aq) are left blank for you to fill out whatever value you want. For example,
if you want a circle island, with volcano elevation, 3 lakes, and 5 aquifers the commands would be: 

java -jar generator/generator.jar -k irregular -h 1080 -w 1920 -p 1000 -s 20 -o img/irregular.mesh;
java -jar island/island.jar -i img/irregular.mesh -o img/transition.mesh -s circle -a volcano -l 3 -aq 5;
java -jar visualizer/visualizer.jar -i img/transition.mesh -o img/irregular.svg;

```
    java -jar generator/generator.jar -k irregular -h 1080 -w 1920 -p 1000 -s 20 -o img/irregular.mesh; 
	java -jar island/island.jar -i img/irregular.mesh -o img/transition.mesh -s __ -a __ -l __ -aq __ -soil __ -biome __ -city __; 
	java -jar visualizer/visualizer.jar -i img/transition.mesh -o img/irregular.svg; 
```

To make an island via makefile: 
```
    Go in the makefile, and adjust your values accordingly next the the option tags.
```


### Installation instructions

This product is handled by Maven, as a multi-module project. We assume here that you have cloned the project in a directory named `A2`

To install the different tooling on your computer, simply run:

```
mosser@azrael A2 % mvn install
```

After installation, you'll find an application named `generator.jar` in the `generator` directory, and a file named `visualizer.jar` in the `visualizer` one. 


To visualize the SVG file:

  - Open it with a web browser
  - Convert it into something else with tools like `rsvg-convert`

## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first to `package` (as in `mvn package`) it so that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.

### Definition of Done

The features listed in backlog runs as is described and OOP principles are applied after multiple test runs.
